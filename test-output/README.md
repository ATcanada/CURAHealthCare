CURA Healthcare is a healthcare project that focuses on providing innovative solutions for medical needs. As a software engineer working on the project, I utilized Java as the programming language and Selenium with TestNG framework for automated testing.

Using Java, I wrote code to automate the testing process for various functionalities of the CURA Healthcare system. Selenium, a popular open-source testing tool, was employed to interact with the web application and perform actions such as filling out forms, clicking buttons, and verifying results.

To ensure comprehensive testing coverage, I designed test cases to cover both valid and invalid scenarios. Valid test cases included positive scenarios where the system should behave correctly and produce the expected results. Invalid test cases, on the other hand, aimed to test the system's ability to handle erroneous inputs or edge cases gracefully.

By leveraging the TestNG framework, I organized and executed these test cases efficiently. TestNG provided essential features such as test suite management, and reporting, enabling me to streamline the testing process and obtain meaningful test results.

Throughout the testing phase, I recorded and analyzed the outcomes of each test case. This allowed me to identify any issues or bugs in the CURA Healthcare system and collaborate with the development team to address them promptly.

In summary, as a software engineer working on CURA Healthcare, I utilized Java, Selenium, and the TestNG framework to automate testing, design valid and invalid test cases, and ensure the quality and reliability of the system.
